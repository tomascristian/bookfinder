## Overview

Proof-of-concept App following [Chingu Voyage Pre-Work Tier 3 Solo Project Specifications](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-prework-tier3-bookfinder).

It queries the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) and displays a list of 10 books matching the user's search terms.

## Highlights

- Minimalistic code. Just one HTML file, a CSS file and a JavaScript file (about 200 lines all three put together).
- No dependencies or build process.
- Directly runnable in the browser.
- No media queries. All responsive goodness courtesy of CSS Grid.

## Other notes

- Internet Explorer is not supported.
- No tests, sorry! :(
- It may have some minor styling issues (particularly whith the form elements, due to inconsistent vendor styles on different browsers).
